# Build Cab Fare Estimation
This is the BUILD Cab Fare Estimation project in python. This project aims to create an accurate model for predicting
cab fare. Using the Taxi Trips Chicago 2024 dataset, this project trains a multiple linear regression model to estimate the effects 
of different variables on the cost of the taxi trip. 

This model is useful for consumers to be aware of the various features of a trip that might affect their fare costs, such as pickup location, time of day, and length of trip. One drawback is that the model is trained on data specific to Chicago, IL, and the fare estimations might not be generalizable to other areas. Still, it is a useful tool for recognizing which factors play into fare cost. 

## Running the Code
Find the Kaggle dataset here: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adelanseur/taxi-trips-chicago-2024>.

Download the dataset and place in the same directory as the code. Now, the script can be run. It will import, clean, and
analyze the dataset. 

The python version I used is Python 3.13.5. All required libraries are imported at the beginning of the script.
